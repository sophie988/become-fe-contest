# Become FE — Figma to Live Code

> Internal Competition · Cook Series · 4-Day Sprint

---

## Objective

Convert the **Whales Market Figma design** into a multi-page, interactive React web app using AI as the primary development engine. No coding experience required — AI handles the code, you handle the direction.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React (Vite) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Routing | React Router v6 |
| Data | JSON mock data (no backend) |
| Language | JavaScript or TypeScript |

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Live App
- `npm run dev` → app opens in browser, no errors
- Multiple pages with working navigation
- All buttons/links have real responses — no dead UI
- Mock data renders correctly across all views
- FE logic works: search, filter, sort, tab switch, modal, form input

### 2. Figma vs. Browser Comparison
- Figma open side-by-side with browser during demo
- Layout, spacing, typography, and colors match the design

### 3. AI Showcase
- 3–5 screenshots or conversation links showing your best AI prompts
- Must show iteration — not just a single copy-paste prompt

## Timeline

| Day | Focus | End-of-Day Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Setup | Project runs + GitHub repo link sent to group |
| Day 2 | Build | Core pages navigable + pushed to GitHub |
| Day 3 | Polish | Functional app + AI Showcase ready + final push |
| Day 4 | Present | Live demo to Judging Panel |

> **Daily commit required** — push at the end of Day 1, 2, and 3.

## Scoring

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| AI Utilization (AI Showcase) | 30 |
| Pixel Accuracy & FE Logic | 25 |
| Completeness & Effort | 20 |
| Responsive & Interaction | 15 |
| Presentation | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## Performance Levels

- **Minimum** — Multiple pages run, navigation works, layout roughly matches Figma on desktop.
- **Good** — Pixel-accurate, FE logic working, mock data correct, mobile responsive.
- **Excellent** — Complete flow that feels like a real product, polished animations, fully responsive.

## Rules

1. Full-time for 4 days — no other company tasks.
2. Individual work only — no collaboration on code.
3. React + Tailwind CSS is mandatory.
4. All AI tools permitted: Antigravity, Cursor, Claude Code. Credits provided on request.
5. Save 3–5 best AI prompts throughout the process — don't wait until Day 4.
6. Ask advisors anytime via Telegram DM.
7. Do not quit. Cut scope if needed, but ship something working.
8. Deadlines are firm. Late = point deduction.
9. GitHub repo must be **public**. Send link to Telegram group on Day 1.
10. Push code to GitHub at the end of every day.
